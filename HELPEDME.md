## Inspiration for this project

I stumbled across [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PM0_Er3SvFQ) on freeCodeCamp's YouTube channel and immediately knew `Conway's Game of Life` was something I wanted to create with React. The Github repo can be found [here](https://github.com/beaucarnes/fcc-project-tutorials/tree/master/gameoflife).

## React course on scrimba.com

I was watching this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLX62G4lc44&t=643s) on freeCodeCamp's YouTube channel and was immediately intrigued by the concept of learning with `scrimba` - an environment that relays what an instructor is typing during their screencast into a web based editor and allows students to pause the "video" and interact with code on the fly. This is the [course](https://scrimba.com/g/glearnreact) I complete that kick-started my journey into the world of React.

## Gradient visualizer

I found the [gradient](https://uigradients.com/#Christmas) I'm using to color the cells here in this [collection of color gradients](https://uigradients.com/).

## Glider icon

I was searching for a good favicon for the app and stumbled across this [image](https://img14.androidappsapk.co/300/c/b/b/com.ndelanou.conwaysgameoflife.png), the inspiration for my favicon.

## Icon creation tool

I used this [icon making tool](http://www.xiconeditor.com/) to make the "Glider" favicon for the app
