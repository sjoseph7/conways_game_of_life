## Inspiration for this project

_6 September 2019_

I stumbled across [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PM0_Er3SvFQ) on freeCodeCamp's YouTube channel and immediately knew `Conway's Game of Life` was something I wanted to create with React. The Github repo can be found [here](https://github.com/beaucarnes/fcc-project-tutorials/tree/master/gameoflife).

## React Course on scrimba.com

I was watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLX62G4lc44&t=643s) on freeCodeCamp's YouTube channel and was immediately intrigued by the concept of learning with `scrimba` - an environment that relays what an instructor is typing during their screencast into a web based editor and allows students to pause the "video" and interact with code on the fly. This is the [course](https://scrimba.com/g/glearnreact) I complete that kick-started my journey into the world of React.
