## Conway's Game of Life

Yet another Game of Life visualizer, built with React.

> _Note: This visualizer is not very mobile-friendly, the grid doesn't resize to fit in smaller viewports and some hover effects exhibit undesired behaviors on devices without cursors._

I recently went through a [react course](https://scrimba.com/g/glearnreact) on `scrimba.com` that gave me a better understanding of React and why I should use it. Once I completed the course, I was eager to go out into the world and start creating some React projects - this is the first project I've worked since that course, and I'm sure there will be many more to come.

The underlying code was built with help from [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PM0_Er3SvFQ) on freeCodeCamp's YouTube channel. After working my way through the tutorial, I challenged myself to extend the functionality of the app to differentiate it from the tutorial code (like color-coding groups of cells based on a group size efficiently calculated using union find). This repository showcases my efforts.

**Update: I made a 3D version! ([link](https://github.com/sjoseph7/3d_conways_game_of_life)) ([site](https://sjoseph7-3d-conways-game-of-life.netlify.app/))**
